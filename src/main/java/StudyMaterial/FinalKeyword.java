        /* Properties of Final Keyword*/

        /*
        * Ensuring immutability: When a variable or reference is marked as final, its value cannot be changed once it is assigned. This helps ensure that data is immutable and cannot be accidentally or maliciously modified.
        *
        * Improving performance: The use of final can sometimes help improve performance, as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM) can optimize code more effectively when it knows that certain values or references cannot be changed.
        *
        * Making code easier to understand: By declaring variables, methods, or classes as final, developers can make their code easier to understand and reason about. When a value or reference is marked as final, it is clear that it will not change, which can simplify code analysis and debugging.
        *
        * Promoting code reuse: By declaring methods as final, developers can prevent subclasses from overriding them. This can help promote code reuse and reduce duplication, as subclasses must use the parent classâ€™s implementation of the method.
        *
        * Enhancing security: The use of final can help enhance security by preventing malicious code from modifying sensitive data or behavior.
